Hi ðŸ‘‹ðŸ™‚  

I am a [Systems Engineering](https://uandina.edu.pe/) graduate with a focus on Cybersecurity and AI/ML frameworks, currently pursuing a degree in [Systems Network Administration](https://digitechfp.com/) in Madrid, Spain. My professional journey has led me to work as a Cybersecurity Intern at FIIAPP, where I focus on building secure systems that align with international information security standards.  

My academic and technical background includes optimizing and ``fine-tuning`` Large Language Models (LLMs), implementing ``quantization`` techniques to enhance efficiency, and exploring ``retrieval-augmented generation`` (RAG) methods for AI applications. I am passionate about leveraging AI and embedded systems to develop educational tools that address challenges in underserved communities, particularly in rural areas.
