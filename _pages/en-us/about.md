Hi 👋🙂

I am a Systems Engineering graduate specialized in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence **frameworks**.

My cybersecurity background includes vulnerability intelligence, secure architecture design, and adversarial threat modeling, implemented across hybrid infrastructures under international frameworks such as `ISO/IEC 27001/22301`, `NIST CSF`, and `ENS`. I ensure compliance with data protection regulations like `GDPR`, integrating access control, traceability, and rapid response mechanisms in regulated environments.

In AI, I build modular systems around large language models, with emphasis on `prompt engineering`, behavioral control, and secure deployment. I develop agentic architectures with planning and tool-use capabilities, including `code-executing agents` operating in sandboxed, auditable environments. Data pipelines involve filtering, augmentation, and synthetic data generation via simulation and controlled sampling to support both supervised and reinforcement learning. Alignment strategies include `DPO` and `GRPO`, with robustness enhanced through adversarial evaluation.

My work integrates `AI safety` principles across the model lifecycle—aligned with the `AI Act` (EU), `GDPR`, the `OECD AI Principles`, and `ISO/IEC TR 24368`, which provides technical guidance on AI system risks, resilience, and trustworthiness. I aim to build systems that are trustworthy, compliant, and technically robust for real-world, high-stakes environments.
